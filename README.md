Software Design Document

1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they    want you to design?

"Draw It or Lose It is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. Rather than a player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing), the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit.
The staff at The Gaming Room does not know how to set up the environment. To facilitate the development of the web-based version of the gaming app, they will need your help in streamlining the development."

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Youtube research to make understanding the text much more easier.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The UML diagram will probably be most helpful.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Maybe the storage and memory management recommendations. Now that I have more knowledge on Serverless computing I might add more info abbout where that data can be stored instead.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Made Different classes and objects to be manipulated such as the team and players in the code to meet all the clients needs.
It is important to not only consider but excceed the users needs as thats the job we were hired to do.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approach it by doing research on whatever I don't understand first. As in whats legible for me in the code. And then do research on how to achieve what it is that client needs. Creating pseudocode or a UML diagram in the process. Next, I move on from there to implemeting those needs into the code and then debugging.
